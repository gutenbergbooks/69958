<p class="drop-cap">As you approach the City of the Dinner
Pail from the west, the blue
waters of the harbor lie between you and
the towering factories which line the opposite
shore. By day the factories are not
attractive to the eye, their massive granite
walls, prison-like and unlovely, suggest only
the sordid side of toil,—the long day’s confinement
of twenty-seven thousand men and
women amidst the monotonous roar of
grinding wheels. But should you thus approach
the city late on a winter afternoon
the scene is marvelously changed; the myriad
lights of the factories shine through the
early darkness, transforming prison-walls
into fairy palaces, castles of enchantment
reflected with mysterious beauty in the deep
waters of the bay. There is no suggestion
now of sordid toil, the factory walls have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</span>
become ramparts of light and speak of some
romantic story.</p>

<p>Realism and romance lie very near together,
and we shall find the factory, when
we come to study the history of it, something
more than granite walls and grinding
machinery; the factory, indeed, has been an
important instrument in the upward progress
of mankind. There is an ugly side to
the story, especially in the beginning, for
when the craftsmen of the world were transformed
into factory operatives, thousands
suffered a degree of poverty never known
before, and many perished in the transition
to the new system of manufacturing; but
in the end that system revolutionized the
whole social order, gave to toil its rightful
dignity, and, creating a new loyalty to
the cause of labor, became an element in
the development of modern democracy.
It is this brighter side of the story that
we have now to consider.</p>

THE INDUSTRIAL<br>
REVOLUTION</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">In the fifteenth century the wealth of
England, which until then had been
made up chiefly of raw products, was
greatly increased by the introduction of
manufactures, the most important being
the making of cloth. Previous to this first
extension of industry, it had been impossible
for the toiler to rise out of his class
except by becoming a priest or a soldier;
but with the increase of manufactures wealth
became a means of social advancement, and
thus industry not only tended to break down
the feudal order by tempting serfs away
from their masters, but the wealth created<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
by manufactures became an important element
in the creation of the middle class.</p>

<p>The sudden and extensive introduction
of machinery at the close of the eighteenth
century drove hand labor out of employment,
and, for a time, caused great suffering
among the masses; but in the end it
created an ever increasing demand for
labor—a new labor more skillful than the
old. Moreover, it concentrated the laboring
population in great centres of industry,
thus creating a class consciousness which
demanded that attention should be given
to the rights of labor, created a new ideal
of the dignity of toil and gave to the world
that vision of the inclusive cause of labor
which was destined to advance in a marvelous
way to the social progress of mankind.</p>

<p>Slavery had been abolished in England
long before the Industrial Revolution, and
yet, in the first quarter of the last century
men in chains worked in the British coal-mines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
and were bought and sold when the
property changed hands. For generations
before the Industrial Revolution, the lord
of the manor had ceased to demand the
labor of the villein as his due, but while serfdom
had been abolished, the traditions of it
still remained; and it was not until the establishment
of the factory that labor became
free in fact as for generations it had
been in name.</p>

<p>The historical event, that great movement
which led in our generation to a
complete reconstruction of the social order,
we call the “Industrial Revolution
of the Eighteenth Century.” It was an
extremely complex event, originating in
economic, political, and social conditions;
but while it was the consequence of many
causes, it derived its chief influence in
the beginning from a series of remarkable
inventions in the art of making textile
fabrics.</p>

<p>This art is as old as civilization, originating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
when men, advancing from barbarism,
put aside the skins of beasts for raiment of
their own making; but from the days of
the first rude distaff and the simple bamboo
loom until the time so recently past when,
by a series of the most brilliant inventions
known to any craft, the art was revolutionized,
the implements remained unchanged.
Up to the year 1769 the machines in use
in the manufacture of cotton cloth in
England were practically the same as those
which for centuries had been employed in
India. There were no factories as there
are to-day: the cotton was spun and woven
into cloth by hand, and both the spinning
and the weaving were done in the cottages
of the craftsmen.</p>

<p>The first of these inventions was a simple
one, but it made necessary all that
followed. From the beginning of the art,
one man could weave into cloth all the
yarn that several spinners could produce.
Indeed, it was seldom that a weaver’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
family, his wife and children all working
at the spinning wheel, could supply sufficient
weft for his loom; and this difficulty
was increased by the invention of the fly-shuttle
in the year 1738. This invention,
made by John Kay, consisted in giving
motion to the shuttle by a mechanical device
which saved time and exertion to the
weaver and nearly doubled the daily product
of his loom. The increased demand
for yarn led to many experiments, and at
last a machine was produced upon which
many threads could be spun by a single
pair of hands: the water frame commonly
attributed to Richard Arkwright. With
this important invention came many others
in the same field, making famous the
names of Hargreaves, Crompton, and Cartwright.</p>

<p>The moment it became possible to accomplish
by machinery what formerly had
been done entirely by hand, the first effect
was to increase the productive power of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
the workman and thus to add vastly to the
wealth of the nation, and secondly, to
gather into the factories the craftsmen who
had formerly worked in their homes.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the eighteenth century
the textile manufacturing of England
was carried on by craftsmen dwelling in
the rural districts, the master clothiers living
in the greater towns, sending out wool
to be spun into yarn which, returned to
them prepared for the loom, was re-distributed
among other hand workers in
other cottages. The Lancashire weaver
worked in his cottage surrounded by a bit
of land, and generally combined small
farming with domestic manufacturing.
Sometimes a single family performed all
the labor, the wife and daughters working
at carding and spinning, the father operating
the loom; sometimes other craftsmen joined
the household and worked as members of
one family. The extent of mercantile establishments
and the modes of doing business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
were very different from what they
were soon to become. It is quite true that a
limited number of individuals had, in previous
ages, made fortunes by trade, but until
the very end of the seventeenth century the
capital in the hands of British merchants
was small. Because of the bad condition of
the roads and the lack of inland navigation,
goods were conveyed by pack horses with
which the Manchester chapmen traveled
through the principal towns, selling their
goods to the shopkeepers, or at the public
fairs, and bringing back sheep’s wool to be
sold to the clothiers of the manufacturing
districts.</p>

<p>In the writings of modern socialists we
find the domestic system held up for admiration
as the ideal method of production.
The dreamers look back regretfully to the
days when manufactures were combined
with farming, and they quote from Goldsmith’s
<cite>Deserted Village</cite>. Let us, however,
turn to a more prosaic but more trustworthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
account, which is to be found in Daniel
Defoe’s <cite>Plan of the English Commerce</cite>. The
author is writing enthusiastically in praise
of English manufactures, and, having
pointed out how in the unemployed counties
women and children are seen idle and
out of business, the women sitting at their
doors, the children playing in the street, he
continues: “Whereas, in the manufacturing
counties, you see the wheel going almost
at every door, the wool and yarn hanging
up at every window; the looms, the winders,
the combers, the carders, the dyers, the
dressers all busy; and the very children as
well as the women constantly employed
... indeed there is not a poor child in
the town above the age of four but can
earn his own bread.”</p>

<p>When we come to study the brutalizing
social conditions which obtained in the
manufacturing towns following the establishment
of the factory, we shall do well
to keep in mind these words written by an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
eighteenth century student in praise of the
domestic system; when we hear the socialists
declare that the factory created wage
slavery, let us remember this earlier and
more monstrous slavery.</p>

<p>Richard Arkwright, the inventor of the
spinning-frame, was a man of great genius.
Endowed with the inventive faculty, and
even more with the ability to perfect the
inventions of others, he possessed as well
extraordinary executive ability, and having
brought his spinning machinery to the
point of practical efficiency, he organized
the modern factory system as the means of
obtaining the highest results from the new
mechanisms. The spinning frame was too
cumbersome to be operated in the cottage,
and, moreover, it required a greater power
to operate it than that of the human hand,
so Arkwright built his first factory which
was run by horse power, and from this beginning
was evolved the factory as we know
it to-day. But important as were the inventions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
in cotton manufacture, the factory
would never have become the mighty
power that it is, except for the steam
engine; and it is interesting to note that in
the same year in which Arkwright took
out his patent for spinning by rollers, Watt
invented his device for lessening the consumption
of fuel in fire engines, that epoch-making
invention by means of which the
factory system as perfected by Arkwright
was to become the material basis of modern
life.</p>

<p>Like the Renaissance, the Industrial
Revolution was a movement destined to
change the very course of human thought.
Mechanical invention contributed to the
force of the earlier movement—the invention
of printing and of the mariner’s
compass—so that side by side with the
scholars restoring to the world its lost heritage
of learning, craftsmen and sailors played
their parts in printing the books by which
the learning was disseminated, and in manning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
the ships that discovered new continents.
The Renaissance, however, was
essentially an intellectual movement to
which mechanical invention was merely
an aid, while the Industrial Revolution was
due in an important measure to machinery.
The movement began in the cotton industry,
but soon a similar expansion occurred
in all other manufactures. Machinery made
possible a vast production; and the steam
engine, first applied to manufacture, later
became the means of distributing the commodities.</p>

<p>The Industrial Revolution, thus springing
from the sudden growth in the use of
machinery, occasioned not only economic
but political and social results. On the economic
side, the effect was to extend old industries
and to create new ones, as well as to
revolutionize the methods of the production
and distribution of wealth. On the social
side it created new classes of men, breaking
down the barriers of ancient feudalism, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
on the political side it led to the enfranchisement
of the working classes. The Industrial
Revolution accomplished for England
what the political revolution did for
France, but by more peaceful means. Yet
not alone in France was the event achieved
in blood—for the Factory as well as the
Terror had its victims. The history of the
factory is no dry summary of patent rights
and inventions, inventories of cotton and
cotton goods, abstracts of ledgers, journals,
cash-books, and pay-rolls,—it is a human
story,—<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez-faire</i>, over-production,
enlightened selfishness, were no abstract
terms, but vital human problems.</p>

<p>Because the Industrial Revolution profoundly
influenced the social and political
life of England, and later of the whole
world, the history of the factory, which
contributed so much to its influence, becomes
of vast importance. The first chapter
relates to brilliant achievements in the
field of mechanical invention. Then follows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
the dismal story of how a multitude
of craftsmen were transformed into factory
operatives—the untold suffering of oppressed
workingmen. Later we see the English
yeoman replaced by the master manufacturer
who soon became a force in the
political life of the nation, finding his way
into Parliament and even into the Peerage.
For the common people the revolution began
with great suffering, but ended in opening
new avenues for their social and political
advancement. Antagonistic in the beginning
to the welfare of the masses, it aided
powerfully, in the end, the fulfillment of
those ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity
which at that moment had taken such
a mighty hold upon the thoughts of men.</p>

SIR RICHARD ARKWRIGHT</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">The <em>Shaving of Shagpat</em>, that remarkable
allegory with the writing of
which George Meredith commenced his
literary career, has been given several interpretations;
without seriously venturing
another, it has seemed to me that this fanciful
story deals with the chief events in
the Industrial Revolution.</p>

<p>“So there was feasting in the hall and in
the city, and over earth”: we read towards
the end of the tale, “great pledging the
sovereign of Barbers, who had mastered an
event and become the benefactor of his craft
and of his kind. ’Tis sure the race of Bagarags
endured for many centuries, and his
seed were the rulers of men, and the seal
of their empire stamped on mighty wax
the Tackle of Barbers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>Shibli Bagarag,—could he not well
have been Richard Arkwright, the barber,
inventor of the spinning-frame, master of
an event? In Shagpat the Clothier, we
discover the smug and comfortable British
aristocracy; in the Identical, that magic
hair in Shagpat’s beard which gave him
a position of power greater even than the
King, we observe Feudal Privilege; the
sword of Aklis, with the steel of which
the Identical was cut, may well stand for
the factory, a weapon gained after many
trials by Arkwright, so that of him it might
be written as it was of Shibli Bagarag:
“Thou, even thou will be master of the
event, so named in anecdotes, and histories,
and records, to all succeeding generations.”</p>

<p>Richard Arkwright, who first saw the
light of day at Preston on the 23d of
December, 1732, was the youngest of thirteen
children born to humble parents, and
he grew to manhood without education,
being barely able to read and write. At an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
early age he was apprenticed to a Preston
barber and when he became a journeyman
he established himself in the same business.</p>

<p>Fate was in a jesting mood when she
decreed that the chief actor in that remarkable
social drama, the Industrial Revolution,
should be a penny barber; and we
may wonder if the governing classes appreciated
the irony, when twenty years later,
in recognition of his genius, the barber was
raised to the honor of knighthood and his
lady privileged to walk before the wives of
the untitled gentry.</p>

<p>Richard Arkwright, at the age of twenty-eight,
was not content day after day to
shave the stolid faces of lower class Englishmen,
but, having gained a knowledge
of a chemical process for dyeing human
hair, he commenced to make wigs for upper
class Englishmen—wigs dyed to suit
any complexion. This occupation took
him away from the barber’s chair and sent
him traveling about the country. On such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
a tour in 1761, he met a lady in the city
of Leigh,—Margaret Biggins was her
name,—and he married her; and in the
same city at a somewhat later date he heard
of certain experiments which had been
made by a man named High in constructing
a machine for spinning yarn. He gained
this secret from a clock-maker named Kay,
with whom he afterwards formed a partnership,
by getting Kay—so the gossips
said—loquaciously drunk at a public-house.
Concerning his wife, history has
little to say except that she quarreled with
him because of the interest he took in
High’s machine; and commencing to make
experiments on his own account he became
so absorbed in his workshop that his
lady, fearing that they might be thrown
upon the parish for support, begged him to
return to his razor, and because he refused
smashed the first model of the spinning-machine
and thus precipitated a tremendous
family row.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>Arkwright is commonly credited with
the invention of spinning by rollers, but
while to him is undoubtedly due the success
of that invention he did not originate
it. The inventor of that ingenious process
was neither Arkwright nor High, but John
Wyatt of Birmingham, who in 1738 took
out a patent in the name of Lewis Paul.
In 1741 or 1742 these two men set up in
Birmingham a mill “turned by two asses
walking around an axis,” and in which ten
girls were employed; while later a larger
mill containing two hundred and fifty spindles
and giving employment to twenty-five
operatives was built. Wyatt wrote a pamphlet
entitled, <cite>A Systematic Essay on the
Business of Spinning</cite>, in which he showed
the great profits which would attend the
establishment of a plant of three hundred
spindles. Wyatt’s factory, however, did not
prosper and it seems probable that his machinery
also passed into the hands of Arkwright.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>It was in the year 1767 that Hargreaves
invented the spinning-jenny, and two years
later Arkwright took out his patent claiming
that he had “by great study and long
application invented a new piece of machinery,
never before found out, practiced
or used, for the making of weft or yarn
from cotton, flax, and wool; which would
be of great utility to a great many manufacturers,
as well as to His Majesty’s subjects
in general, by employing a great number
of poor people in working the said
machinery and in making the said weft or
yarn much superior in quality to any heretofore
manufactured or made.” However
lacking in originality this famous invention
may have been, however great may have
been the debt which Arkwright owed to
Wyatt and Paul, to John Kay and to High,
nevertheless, to him belongs all the credit
of the first successful introduction of spinning
by machinery.</p>

<p>Having obtained this patent, Arkwright<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
found himself without the capital necessary
for carrying out his plans; and he returned
to his native city of Preston and there
applied to a friend, Mr. John Smalley, a
liquor merchant, for assistance. So reduced
were his circumstances at this time that
going to vote at a contested election, which
occurred during his visit to Preston, his
wardrobe was in so tattered a condition that
a number of his friends advanced the money
to purchase decent clothes in which he
might appear in the poll-room; and once
during this period he having applied for
pecuniary aid to a Mr. Atherton, that gentleman
refused to entertain Arkwright’s
plan because of the rags in which the inventor
was dressed.</p>

<p>It was in Preston, then, that Arkwright
first fitted up his perfected spinning machine,
in the parlor of a house belonging to
the free grammar school. Here Arkwright
successfully demonstrated the utility of his
invention and first received financial support.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
In consequence of the riots which had
taken place in the neighborhood of Blackburn
on the invention of Hargreaves’s spinning-jenny,
by which many of the machines
were destroyed and the inventor
driven from his native county to Nottingham,
Arkwright and Smalley, fearing similar
outrages, also went to Nottingham
accompanied by John Kay, the loquacious
clock-maker; so that Nottingham became
the cradle of the two great inventions in
cotton spinning. Here, Arkwright also
applied for aid to the Messrs. Wright,
Bankers, who made advances on the condition
that they should share in the profits
of the invention; but as the machine was
not perfected as soon as they had hoped
they withdrew their support and he turned
to Mr. Samuel Need, a partner of Jedidiah
Strutt, the inventor of the stocking frame.
Strutt examined Arkwright’s mechanism,
declared it to be an admirable invention,
and the two men of wealth agreed to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
partnership with the Preston barber; and
a mill was erected at Nottingham.</p>

<p>It was an unpretentious establishment,
that first little cotton mill; it gave employment
to not more than a dozen operatives,
and the machinery was turned not
by a great steam engine, but by a pair of
patient horses harnessed to a treadmill,—yet
it contained the germ of the modern
factory and the modern factory system.
Later, Arkwright built another and larger
factory at Cromford in Derbyshire, driven
by water power—from which circumstance
his spinning-machine came to be
called the water-frame.</p>

<p>The cotton industry of England which
Arkwright established developed slowly;
in the five years, ending with 1775, the
annual import of cotton into Great Britain
was only four times the average import at
the beginning of the century. But when
in the year 1785 Arkwright’s patent was
finally set aside and his spinning machinery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
became public property, a great extension
of cotton manufacture followed, accompanied
by a marvelous national prosperity.
Arkwright, although deprived of his monopoly,
was by this time so firmly established
in the industry that he remained the
dominant figure in the yarn market, fixing
the price of the commodity for all
other spinners; and thus he accumulated a
great fortune.</p>

<p>While Arkwright was without doubt
perfectly familiar with the experiments of
both Wyatt and High, nevertheless it was
the Preston barber and not the original
inventors who first produced yarn fit for
weaving. It is proverbial that inventors seldom
reap the harvest of wealth which they
sow; they are the dreamers and their reward
is in beholding a perfected mechanism—their
work of art. So it was
with Wyatt and High. They dreamed of
spindles turned by power and saw their
spindles turn; but Arkwright dreamed of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
a nation made rich and powerful by these
same inventions, and he, too, lived to see
his dream come true.</p>

<p>Sir Richard Arkwright possessed all the
qualities essential to success—tireless energy,
enthusiasm, perseverance, and self-confidence.
He believed in himself and so
he compelled others to believe in him.
His usual working day began at five o’clock
in the morning and did not end until nine
at night; when he was fifty years of age
he lengthened this day by two hours,
which he devoted to acquiring the education
denied him in his youth. He had unbounded
confidence in the success of his adventures
and was accustomed to say that he
would pay the national debt—an interesting
circumstance, for surely by his genius
the national debt was paid many times over.</p>

<p>In the year 1786 he was appointed
high sheriff of Derbyshire, and when
about that time the King narrowly escaped
assassination at the hands of Margaret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
Nicholson, Arkwright, having presented
an address of congratulation from his
county to the King, received the honor
of knighthood. He died on the 3d of August,
1792, at the age of sixty. The <cite>Annual
Register</cite> recording that event says not so
much as a single word concerning Arkwright’s
masterful genius which even then
had set in motion a mighty social revolution.
It mentions only the great fortune
which he had acquired as a manufacturer
of cotton yarn,—so difficult it is for the
critic to place a true value on the life
work of a contemporary.</p>

<p>As you approach the City of the Dinner
Pail from the west and gaze across the
blue waters of the harbor, the eye rests
upon the towering factories which line
the opposite shore. Within those walls
twenty-seven thousand men and women
living in a degree of comfort never
known before to the spinners and weavers
of the world, earn their daily bread.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
Those towering factories are, every one,
monuments to the genius of Richard Arkwright,
the penny barber of Preston. If
he appropriated the inventions of others,
he perfected these inventions and made
them of permanent value to mankind;
and moreover, he arranged the machinery
into series, organized the factory system,
and revolutionized industry.</p>

<p>Says Carlyle: “Richard Arkwright, it
would seem, was not a beautiful man; no
romance hero with haughty eyes, Apollo
lip, and gesture like the herald Mercury;
a plain, almost gross, bag-cheeked, pot-bellied
Lancashire man, with an air of
painful reflection, yet also of copious free
digestion;—a man stationed by the community
to shave certain dusty beards in the
northern parts of England at halfpenny
each.... Nevertheless, in strapping
razors, in lathering of dusty beards, and
the contradictions and confusions attendant
thereon the man had notions in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
rough head of his; spindles, shuttles,
wheels and contrivances plying ideally
within the same, rather hopeless looking,
which, however, he did at last bring to
bear. Not without great difficulty! his
townsfolk rose in mob against him, for
threatening to shorten labor, to shorten
wages; so that he had to fly, with broken
wash pots, scattered household, and seek
refuge elsewhere. Nay, his wife, too, rebelled;
burned his wooden model of his
spinning wheel; resolute that he should
stick to his razors, rather;—for which,
however, he decisively, as thou wilt rejoice
to understand, packed her out of doors.
Oh! reader, what a Historical Phenomenon
is that bag-cheeked, pot-bellied,
much-enduring, much-inventing barber!
French revolutions were a-brewing, to resist
the same in any measure, Imperial
Kaisers were impotent without the cotton
and cloth of England; and it was this man
who gave to England the power of cotton.”</p>

MECHANICAL INVENTIONS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A distinction should be made between
the factory and the factory
system. The latter was not new to England,
having been employed during the Roman
occupation; and with the introduction of
the woolen industry under Edward III, we
again find the factory system established on
an extensive scale.</p>

<p>John Winchcombe, commonly called
Jack of Newbury, who died about the year
1520, made use of the factory system on a
very extensive scale. In Fuller’s <cite>Worthies</cite> you
may read how he “was the most considerable
clothier without fancy or fiction England
ever beheld,” and how “his looms were
his lands, whereof he kept one hundred in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
his house, each managed by a man and a
boy.” Jack of Newbury was celebrated in
a metrical romance, and the following lines
taken from it contain an interesting description
of his famous industrial establishment.</p>

<p>Here, indeed, we have the factory system—in
which the division of labor is a
conspicuous feature—employed with all
its modern details; but not the steam-driven
factory, building great cities and changing
the whole social life of the kingdom.</p>

<p>The original mode of converting cotton
into yarn was by the use of distaff and spindle,
a method still employed in the remote parts
of India. The distaff is a wooden rod to
which a bundle of cotton is tied loosely at
one end, and which the spinner holds between
the left arm and the body while with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
his right hand he draws out and twists the
cotton into a thread. This simple process
is the basis of all the complicated spinning
machinery in use at the present time.</p>

<p>In a modern cotton factory there are
three departments of labor, carding, spinning,
and weaving; and we have now to
consider briefly these three processes. The
purpose of carding is to clean the cotton and
lay the fibres in a uniform direction. This
was at first accomplished by hand, the implement
employed being little different
from an ordinary comb; later an improved
device was used consisting of a pair of large
wire brushes. This, we must observe, was
a primitive operation, and the amount of
cotton which one person could thus prepare
for spinning was very small.</p>

<p>We have already seen that the invention
of the fly-shuttle so increased the demand
for yarn that ingenious men were induced
to make mechanical experiments for the
purpose of supplying this demand—experiments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
which, in the end, led to the
invention of the spinning-frame. The spinning-frame,
in turn, increased the demand
for carded cotton and skillful mechanics
again set about to meet this new requirement,
and the result was the building of the
carding-engine. This invention was not
made at once, nor by any particular individual;
but was the result of a number of
improvements made at different times and
by different persons. One of these men
was Thomas High, the inventor of the
spinning-jenny; another was James Hargreaves
who so improved the jenny that he
is commonly called the inventor of it; and
finally, Richard Arkwright himself took the
crude machine devised by these men and perfected
it. Thus it came about that the modern
carding-engine as well as the spinning-frame,
was made of practical value by this
much-enduring, much-inventing barber.</p>

<p>The invention of the fly-shuttle, as we
have seen, led to an increased demand for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
yarn, and this demand was further augmented
about the year 1760 when the
Manchester merchants began to export
cotton goods in considerable quantities to
Italy, Germany, and the North American
colonies. It was then no uncommon thing
for a weaver to walk three or four miles
in the morning, and call on five or six spinners,
before he could collect yarn enough
to serve him for the remainder of the day.</p>

<p>Ingenious mechanics set about the task
of producing more yarn. The first of these
was Thomas High, a reed maker, residing
in the town of Leigh, who engaged one
Kay, a clock-maker, and this is the same
Kay who was afterwards employed by Arkwright
to make the wheels and other apparatus
for a spinning-machine. This machine
was set up in the garret of High’s house.
Now, Thomas High had a daughter who
watched with keen interest the progress of
his experiments—her name was Jane—and
in honor of her he called the machine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
the spinning-jenny. It is commonly stated—even
in so authoritative a history as
Baines’s we find the error—that the credit
for the original invention of the spinning-jenny
is due to Hargreaves, he having made
the first machine in 1767. But Guest has
shown quite conclusively by the sworn statement
of one Thomas Leather, a neighbor
of High, that the latter completed a similar
machine in 1764.</p>

<p>However this may be, James Hargreaves,
a weaver of Stand-Hill, near Blackburn,
perfected the original jenny and made it a
practical working machine so that history
has quite justly named him the author.
From the first Hargreaves was aware of
the value of his invention, but not having
the ambition to obtain a patent he kept the
machine as secret as possible, using it only
to spin yarn for his own weaving. An unprotected
invention of such importance,
however, could not remain long the private
property of a single weaver, and soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
a knowledge of his achievement spread
throughout the neighborhood; but instead
of gaining admiration and gratitude for
Hargreaves, the spinners raised the cry that
the invention would throw multitudes out
of employment and a mob broke into his
house and destroyed his jenny.</p>

<p>After this, Hargreaves moved to Nottingham,
where, with a Mr. Thomas James,
he raised sufficient capital to erect a small
mill; here he took out a patent in 1770,—one
year after Arkwright had patented the
water-frame. Before leaving Lancashire,
Hargreaves made and sold to other weavers
a number of jennies; and in spite of all
opposition the importance of the invention
led to its general use.</p>

<p>A desperate effort was made in 1779,
during a period of distress, to put down
the machine. A mob scoured the country
for miles around Blackburn demolishing
jennies and with them all carding-engines,
water-frames, and other machinery; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
the rioters spared the jennies which had only
twenty spindles, as these were by this time
admitted to be useful to the craftsmen. Not
only the working classes, but the middle and
even the upper classes entertained at this
time a profound dread of machinery. The
result of these riots was to drive spinners and
other capitalists from the neighborhood of
Blackburn to Manchester, increasing the
importance of that rapidly growing town
which was destined to become the world
centre of the cotton industry.</p>

<p>The story of this early opposition to the
introduction of machinery deserves attention
not only as an interesting episode in
the history of the factory, but because
even to-day a similar opposition comes to
the surface with each new improvement in
the method of manufacture. It is also an
interesting fact that Lord Byron made his
maiden speech in the House of Lords in
opposition to the Nottingham Riot Bills,
introduced into Parliament for the protection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
of owners of machinery. There were
two of these bills, one “for the more exemplary
punishment of persons destroying
or injurying any stocking- or lace-frames,
or other machines or engines used in the
frame-work knitting manufactory, or any
articles or goods in such frames or machines”;
the other “for the more effectual
preservation of the peace within the
county of Nottingham.”</p>

<p>These two bills were the result of rioting
among the lacemakers of this county
and their object was to increase the
penalty for breaking machinery, from
transportation to death, to permit the
appointment of special constables in times
of disturbance, and to establish watch and
ward throughout the disturbed parts. These
bills and the debates upon them throw a
strong light upon the extent of the disturbances,
and indicate the attitude of the
government, at that time, toward the laboring
poor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>The important inventions in carding and
spinning led to a rapid advance in cotton
manufacture; the new machines not only
turned off a greater quantity of yarn than
had been produced by hand, but the yarn
was also of a superior quality. The water-frame
spun a hard, firm yarn, well adapted
for warps, while the jenny produced a soft
yarn suitable for spinning weft; but the
yarn produced on neither of these machines
could be advantageously used for making
the finer qualities of goods.</p>

<p>This defect in the spinning-machinery
was remedied by still another device called
the mule jenny, but now termed simply
the mule, so named because it combined
the principles of both Arkwright’s water-frame
and Hargreaves’ jenny. The mule
was invented by Samuel Crompton, a
weaver living at Hall-in-the-Wood near
Bolton. He commenced his experiments
in 1774, but it was five years before he
completed the machine. Crompton took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
out no patent and only regretted that public
curiosity would not allow him to keep
his little invention for himself. The mule
was first known as the Hall-in-the-Wood
wheel, then as the muslin wheel because
it made yarn sufficiently fine for weaving
that fabric, and finally by its present name.</p>

<p>As the inventor made no effort to secure
a patent, the mule became public property,
and was generally adopted by manufacturers,
but Crompton himself received no
other reward than a grant of five thousand
pounds voted him by Parliament in 1812.
Although his means were small, he was
always in easy circumstances, until the
latter part of his life, when, being no
longer able to work, he was reduced to
poverty. Certain manufacturers who had
profited by his invention then subscribed
for the purchase of a life annuity, to which
fund foreign as well as English spinners
contributed. Crompton died on January
26, 1827.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>Having considered the inventions in the
art of spinning, we now turn to the power
loom built in 1785 by the Reverend Edmund
Cartwright, of Hollander House,
Kent. A loom moved by water power had
been contrived as early as the seventeenth
century by one De Gennes, and described
as “a new engine to make linen cloth
without the help of an artificer.” But the
machine never came into general use;
and in about the middle of the eighteenth
century there is record of another power
loom, also a French invention, which suffered
a similar fate. Describing his own
loom Cartwright says that in the summer
of 1784 he fell in company with some
gentlemen of Manchester who were discussing
Arkwright’s spinning-machinery.
One of the company observed that, as
soon as Arkwright’s patents expired, so
many mills would be erected and so much
cotton spun that hands could not be found
to weave it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>To this observation the ingenious clergyman
replied that Arkwright should set his
wits to work to invent a weaving-mill.
But the Manchester gentlemen unanimously
agreed that the thing was impractical.
Cartwright argued, however,
that, having seen exhibited in London
an automaton figure which played at
chess, he did not believe it more difficult
to construct a machine which would
weave. He kept this conversation in mind
and later employed a carpenter and a
blacksmith to carry his ideas into effect.
Thus he built a loom which, to his own
delight, produced a piece of cloth. The
machine, however, required two powerful
men to work it, but Cartwright, who was
entirely unfamiliar with the art of weaving,
believed that he had accomplished all that
was required, and on the 4th of April,
1785, he secured a patent. It was only then
that he commenced to study the method
by which the craftsmen wove cloth, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
was astonished when he compared the easy
working of the hand loom with his own
ponderous engine. Profiting by his study,
however, he produced a loom which in its
general principles is precisely the same as
the looms used to-day.</p>

<p>Thus was invented the machinery of
the cotton mill; but there remains to be
considered the one other contrivance without
which the vast extension of manufactures
would have been impossible and
the manufacturing towns, which we are
about to consider, would never have attained
the size and importance which enabled
them to become factors in the political
life of England. I refer to the steam
engine.</p>

<p>In 1763, James Watt was employed in
repairing a model of Newcomen’s steam
engine, and, noting certain basic defects,
undertook to remedy them. He perceived
the vast possibilities of a properly constructed
engine and, after years of patient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
labor he gave to the world the mighty
power of steam. Previous to this time,
and indeed until the year 1782, the steam
engine had been used almost exclusively
to pump water out of mines, but with
Watt’s improvements it became possible
for the engine to give rotary motion to
machinery.</p>

<p>The first cotton mill to install a steam
engine made by Boulton and Watt was the
one owned by the Messrs. Robinson in
Nottinghamshire—this was about the
year 1785. Two years earlier, Arkwright
had made use of an atmospheric engine
in his Manchester factory, but it was not
until 1789 that an improved steam engine
was set up in that city and it was a year
later when Arkwright adopted the device.</p>

<p>The invention of spinning-machinery
created the cotton manufacture of England,
but the industry would never have
reached the proportions which it presently
did except for the genius of Watt.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IV">IV<br>
THE FACTORY SYSTEM</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">When the cotton manufacture was
in its infancy, all the operations,
from dressing the raw material to folding
the finished fabric, were completed under
the roof of the weaver’s cottage. With
Arkwright’s invention it became the custom
to spin the yarn in factories and weave
it by hand in cottages. With the invention
of the power loom, it again became the
practice to perform all the processes in a
single building.</p>

<p>The weaver’s cottage, then, with its rude
apparatus of peg warping, hand cards, spinning-wheels,
and wooden looms, was the
steam factory in miniature; but the amount
of labor performed in a single factory was
as great as that which formerly gave occupation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
to the inhabitants of an entire district.
A good hand-loom weaver could produce
two pieces of shirtings each week; by 1823,
a power-loom weaver produced seven such
pieces in the same time.</p>

<p>A factory containing two hundred looms
was operated by one hundred persons who
wove seven hundred pieces a week, and it
was estimated that under the domestic system
at least eight hundred and seventy-five
looms would have been required to weave
this amount of cloth, because the women
of the household had their home duties to
perform while the men were required to
devote a considerable portion of their time
to farming. It was therefore further estimated
that the work done in a steam factory
containing two hundred looms would,
if performed by hand, give employment
and support to a population of more than
two thousand persons. It is interesting
here to note, that, whereas a hand-loom
weaver could produce two pieces of shirtings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
a week, an ordinary weaver is now
able to turn off eight or ten pieces of equal
length every ten hours; so that a modern
weave room containing two hundred power
looms operated by twenty-five weavers
represents the labor of a community of
sixty thousand craftsmen, their wives and
their children. A population of thirty million
would be required to perform by hand
the work now produced by the Fall River
factories alone.</p>

<p>“Watt,” said a celebrated French engineer,
“improves the steam engine, and
this single improvement causes the industry
of England to make an immense stride.
This machine, at the present time [about
1830], represents the power of three hundred
thousand horses or of two million men,
strong and well fitted for labor, who should
work night and day without an interruption
and without repose.... A hairdresser
invents, or at least brings into action,
a machine for spinning cotton; this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
alone gives the British industry immense
superiority. Fifty years only, after this
great discovery, more than one million of
the inhabitants of England are employed
in those operations which depend, directly
or indirectly, on the action of this
machine. Lastly, England exports cotton,
spun and woven by an admirable system
of machinery, to the value of four hundred
million francs yearly.... The British
navigator travels in quest of the cotton of
India, brings it from a distance of four
thousand leagues, commits it to an operation
of the machines of Arkwright, carries
back their products to the East, making
them again to travel four thousand leagues,
and in spite of the loss of time—in spite
of the enormous expense incurred by this
voyage of eight thousand leagues, the cotton
manufactured by the machinery of
England becomes less costly than the cotton
of India, spun and woven by hand near the
field that produced it, and sold at the nearest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
market. So great is the power of the
progress of machinery.”</p>

<p>Two distinct systems of production preceded
the factory. First, the system of
isolated handicraft labor, and second, the
system of cottage industry, which we have
already considered and in which the several
members of a family participated,—this,
too, was handicraft. The craftsman, as we
have seen, worked with his family in his own
cottage; he owned his loom and the other
simple machinery necessary for the production
of cloth, and either he owned his
raw material or received it from the master
manufacturer to be returned in the
form of finished fabric. But in either case,
the craftsman was his own master and
sold cloth not labor.</p>

<p>With the establishment of the factory,
these conditions were completely changed.
The master manufacturer not only owned
the factory building and the machinery,
but he owned the raw material. Moreover<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
to him the operative sold his labor which
thereby became a commodity quite as completely
as the cotton he wove into cloth.
This latter circumstance is important because
it became the source of the vast social
discontent which, in the end, aided
powerfully in revolutionizing the structure
of British society.</p>

<p>To the consideration of this event we
shall soon return. For the moment we must
consider briefly the most characteristic
distinction in the process of manufacture
under the new system—the extension of
the principle of division of labor.</p>

<p>The principle itself was in no wise new,
for the first application of it was made in
a very early stage in the evolution of society.
At the very dawn of civilization it
must have become apparent that more comforts
and conveniences could be acquired
by one man restricting his occupation to a
single craft—and the development of independent
arts was in itself a division of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
labor. The same principle was then carried
into the different trades, and at last we find
it fully developed in the cottage system of
industry. Thus we find carding, spinning,
and weaving carried on by separate members
of the family. Carding and spinning,
which required less bodily strength, was
performed by the women, while the more
laborious work of weaving was given over
to the men. With the establishment of the
factory and the introduction of machinery,
means were supplied by which this system
could attain its highest development.</p>

<p>The advantages resulting from the division
of labor are evident. When the
whole work in any art is executed by one
person, that person must possess sufficient
skill to perform the most difficult, and sufficient
strength to perform the most laborious,
of the processes; but by employing
a division of labor several persons may be
kept at work executing that part of the
whole for which he is best fitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>The further advantages may be most
briefly stated in the familiar words of Adam
Smith: “The great increase in the quantity
of work, which, in consequence of the division
of labor, the same number of people
are capable of performing, is owing to three
different circumstances: first, to the increase
of dexterity in every particular workingman;
secondly, to the saving of time, which
is commonly lost in passing from one species
of work to another, and, lastly, to the
invention of a great number of machines
which facilitate and abridge labor and enable
one man to do the work of many.”</p>

<p>It should be noted that the factory was,
in the beginning, not the creation of capital,
but of labor. The early master manufacturers
were risen workingmen. Sir Richard
Arkwright, the creator of the factory,
the man who dominated industrial activities
in the first great period of expansion,
was a penny barber; but he died a Knight
Bachelor with an income greater than that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
of many a prince. The process of social
elevation by means of trade began back in
the fifteenth century with the first extension
of manufactures. By the beginning of
the eighteenth century it was possible to
name five hundred great estates within a
hundred miles of London, which, at no
remote time, had been possessions of the
ancient English gentry, but had later been
bought up by tradesmen and manufacturers.
The ancestors of these new landed proprietors
had been, less than three hundred years
before, not soldiers, but serfs.</p>

<p>Moreover, generations before the establishment
of the factory, important towns
had been raised by manufactures—towns
of which Manchester and Birmingham
were examples, in which there were few or
no families of the gentry, yet which were
full of families richer by far than many a
noble house. And side by side with this process
of tradesmen rising to the gentry had
gone the other process of declining gentry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
placing their sons in trade. So, as Defoe
pithily said, “Tradesmen became gentlemen
by gentlemen becoming tradesmen.”</p>

<p>The successful artisan under the domestic
system became in time master clothier,
and when the factory became the means of
further increase to their fortunes the capital
which this class had already amassed
was utilized in building mills and machinery.
To this class belonged the grandfather
of Sir Robert Peel, a resident of
Blackburn, who supported himself from the
profits of a farm in the neighborhood and
devoted his spare time to mechanical experiments.
From this he came to operate
a print-works, and later commenced the
manufacture of cloth.</p>

<p>His son, the first Sir Robert,—the father
of the Prime Minister,—was apprenticed
to the trade and came to manhood at the
time when the impulse given to manufactures
in England, through the introduction
of machinery, led to a more rapid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
accumulation of wealth than had been
known in any previous period of history.
It is said that in his youth Robert Peel entertained
a presentiment that he would become
the founder of a family. By means of
the factory, he amassed a fortune, was raised
to the honor of knighthood, and realized
his presentiment—for in the next generation
no name is more famous in the annals
of government than that of Sir Robert Peel,
the grandson of a domestic manufacturer.</p>

<p>As the number of factories increased it
became possible for operatives to rise, first
to positions of trust within the factory, and
later to the rank of master manufacturer—so
that many a bobbin boy became a
cotton lord.</p>

<p>Within the factory the effect was to
intensify that spirit of discontent which
presently arose among the workers—for
risen workingmen are apt to prove the
hardest task masters. A graphic picture of
this aspect of factory life as it existed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
Manchester in the first half of the last century,
when discontent had become articulate
and the great Chartist movement
reached its height is to be found in Dickens’s
<cite>Hard Times</cite>. In that story Josiah
Bounderby of Coketown is typical of this
class of risen workingmen—the early employers
of labor under the factory system;
Josiah Bounderby, who learnt his letters
from the outside of shops and was first
able to tell time from studying the steeple
clock at St. Giles’s Church, London; Josiah
Bounderby, vagabond, errand boy, laborer,
porter, clerk, chief manager, small partner,
merchant, banker, manufacturer. There
was very little in the training of Josiah
Bounderby, or any of his class to make them
humane employers of labor—and among
the several causes which made the early relation
of employer and employee under the
factory system one of bitter strife, this cause,
so strictly social in its origin, is one of the
most important.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>The establishment of the factory altered
completely the relation between employer
and employee. Indeed in the modern sense
these relations were then first established.
Labor became a commodity which the
master manufacturer, who was also the
capitalist, bought and which the workingman
sold. When in the year 1785 Arkwright’s
patents were set aside and the use
of his perfected spinning machinery became
free to all manufacturers, a great extension
of the cotton industry followed.
Factories were built throughout Lancashire
and about these factories important cities
sprang up in which the modern problem
of the relation of employer and employee
had its beginning.</p>

<p>The factory produced cloth more cheaply
and in far greater quantity than was possible
under the domestic system. Hand
workers sought employment in the factories.
Vast numbers of purely agricultural
laborers left the rural districts for the manufacturing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
towns. And, augmenting this
great supply of labor, came thousands of
children—for an eight-year-old child was
capable of operating a spinning-frame, in
which, for this very reason, the spindles
were set near to the floor. With an unlimited
supply of labor, the cotton masters had
only the cost of production to consider, and
so it came about that they thought only of
their profits and forgot the human hands
which operated the machinery. England
had fallen under the sway of a book—Adam
Smith’s <cite>Wealth of Nations</cite>, which, as Southey
said, “considers man as a manufacturing
animal, estimating his importance not by
the goodness and knowledge he possesses,
not by his virtues and charities, not by the
happiness of which he may be the source
and centre, not by the duties to which he
is called, not by the immortal destinies for
which he is created, but by the gain that
may be extracted from him or of which
he may be made the instrument.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>The crowding of this vast laboring population
into great industrial centres, however,
gave rise to a class-consciousness which
demanded that attention should be paid to
the human element which distinguished
labor from all other commodities, demanded
that the cotton masters should
no longer regard the workingman as a
slave, or as merely a part of the machine,
but as a free man, and which demanded
further that this free man should be
recognized as a citizen and given the right
of suffrage.</p>

<p>It would be interesting for us to follow
the history of the factory where we now
leave it, firmly established as the cornerstone
of Great Britain’s wealth, down to
the present time, and trace its development
not only in England and America but
throughout the civilized world. It is a surprising
story of industrial progress, an important
chapter in the social progress of
mankind. But enough has already been said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
to prepare us for the consideration of the
way in which the establishment of the factory
affected England’s laboring poor. The
actual development of the cotton industry
surpasses any dream that even the barber
of Preston could have imagined when he
exclaimed that he, unaided, would pay the
national debt.</p>

<p>Less than a century and a half ago,
Richard Arkwright built his first little mill
at Nottingham which gave employment to
a dozen operatives. To-day there are one
hundred great cotton factories in the city
of Fall River alone, operating three and one
half million spindles, nearly one hundred
thousand looms, and giving employment to
twenty-seven thousand operatives. There
are more than twenty-five million spindles
in daily operation in the United States, and
even a greater number on the continent of
Europe, while Great Britain contains over
fifty million; and when to these we add
the spindles of India, Japan, and China, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
have a total of one hundred and twenty million
spindles giving employment to an army
of workers as great as the entire population
of England when Arkwright took out
his patents for spinning by rollers. Nor is
this all. The factory system first applied to
the cotton industry has been applied to all
manufactures as well as to agriculture and
has become the central fact in modern industrial
life.</p>

<p>We are now to take up the question
of how the establishment of the factory
affected England’s laboring poor, and to
study a little more in detail the social
effects of the Industrial Revolution. In
preparing the way for this discussion we
should remember that the factory was not
the sole cause of the Industrial Revolution,
although it was a very important
one. Other elements besides the introduction
of machinery had gradually made
possible production on a large scale. Chief
among these was the decline of state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
regulation of industry, the development
of rationalism quickening the scientific
spirit, the growth of the empire and
prestige of England which opened great
export markets for the goods of British
manufacture, the extension of banking facilities,
and the construction of roads and
canals. All these were elements in producing
the Industrial Revolution. But what
gave the movement force to revolutionize
the social life of the common people was
the factory, which gathered great masses
of the population into industrial centres in
which became possible the development
of class consciousness.</p>

THE FACTORY TOWNS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">The dictionary contains the history
of the race, if you search deep into
its mysteries; every word tells its own story
and bears its present meaning because men,
at different times, thought precisely as they
did and not otherwise.</p>

<p>Servius Tullius made six divisions of the
citizens of Rome for the purposes of taxation
and these divisions were called classes.
A seventh included the mass of the population,
those who were not possessed of
any taxable property—that is to say the
laboring poor. It is from this circumstance
that our word “class” derives its peculiar
meaning. Now it is significant that before
the great extension of manufactures occasioned
by the factory, we find no reference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
in our language to the working classes.
The laboring poor belonged to no class;
but when great cities grew up about the
factories, populated by toilers whose interests
in life were identical, the masses suddenly
became conscious of their common
life, their common needs, their common
hopes. Blindly at first, and then more
surely, they struggled for recognition as a
class, and at last the struggle found expression
in the language of their time.
The arousing of this class consciousness
amongst the workers I take to be the chief
contribution of the factory to the social
progress of mankind; and for this reason
the rise of the manufacturing towns becomes
a subject of great importance.</p>

<p>In the town hall at Manchester there is
a fresco by Ford Maddox Brown which
bears the title of “The Establishment of
Flemish Weavers in Manchester,” and
shows Queen Philippa visiting the colony
which she founded in 1363. Mr. George<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
Saintsbury, in his history of Manchester,
questions the historical accuracy of the event
portrayed; “but,” he adds, “Queen Philippa
did many things which we should all be sorry
to give up as art and literature and which,
yet, are somewhat dubious history.”</p>

<p>No one knows when Manchester first
became a manufacturing town, and the introduction
of Flemish artificers in the reign
of Edward III is rather a probable than a
certain starting-point. Nothing is distinctly
known of the progress of woolen manufacture,
until the reign of Henry VIII,
at which time it had evidently grown into
considerable importance. In the statute
of the thirty-third year of his reign it appears
that the inhabitants of Manchester
carried on a considerable manufacture both
of linens and woolens by which they were
acquiring great wealth; but no mention has
yet been found of cotton manufacture in
that city earlier than the year 1641. By
this time, however, it had become well
established.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>The labor was entirely handicraft; and
it was not until the establishment of the
factory by Arkwright that Manchester and
the other manufacturing towns of England
came into prominence in the political life
of the nation; indeed it was not until the
nineteenth century was well advanced that
the inhabitants of these cities were represented
in Parliament.</p>

<p>It has been held that the factory is an
episode, not an element, in modern sociological
development, and in a strict sense
this is true. But because the factory led to
the growth of great manufacturing towns
and caused the migration thither of a vast
population from the agricultural districts,
and because it was among this population
that the social discontent, which for a
long period had existed in the lower classes,
first became articulate, the factory directly
contributed to the development of modern
democracy.</p>

<p>The factory transformed not only craftsmen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
into operatives, but agricultural laborers
as well, the latter becoming for
the first time free to dispose of their own
labor; for while serfdom had been declared
illegal long before the establishment of the
factory, yet the peasant remained dependent,
in a large measure, upon the good
will of his employer and he was bound by
custom if not by law to the soil he tilled.
The migration of this vast laboring population
from the fields to the towns led to
far-reaching social results.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>
<p>Thus Wordsworth in <cite>The Excursion</cite> describes
the rise of the manufacturing
towns.</p>

<p>Our first concern is with the social conditions
existing in these great manufacturing
cities. The factory system was first
applied to the spinning of yarn; but weaving
continued, for a time, as a handicraft.
This period was one of great prosperity to
the hand-loom weavers. Before the invention
of spinning-machinery, several spinners
were required to furnish one loom with
yarn; and one half of the weaver’s time
was spent in waiting for work. This time
was employed in farming. But with the
establishment of the spinning-mills the
situation was reversed, and the weaver,
plentifully supplied with yarn, ceased to
cultivate the soil and devoted his whole
time to the loom, a far more profitable
occupation.</p>

<p>Villages of hand-loom weavers sprang
up throughout the country adjacent to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
manufacturing towns, and hither the master
spinners sent their yarn and received
back the finished cloth; while sometimes
the weaving was done in “dandy” shops
containing eight or ten and often as many
as twenty looms. These little factories
were usually owned by a single weaver who
hired others to assist him in his work; but
whatever the method, the profits from the
business were always great.</p>

<p>“One of the happiest sights in Lancashire
life at this time,” writes a contemporary
historian, “was the home of a
family of weavers.... There could be
heard the merry song to the tune of the
clacking shuttles and the bumping of the
lathes; the cottage surrounded with a
garden filled with flowers and situated in
the midst of green fields where the larks
sang and the throstles whistled their
morning adoration to the rising sun. The
weaving thus carried on at home, where
several persons of the same family and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
apprentices were employed, made them
prosperous small manufacturers and a proud
lot of people.” This was about 1800.</p>

<p>“The trade of muslin weaver,” says a
Bolton manufacturer of the same period,
“was that of a gentleman. The weavers
brought home their work in top boots and
ruffled shirts; they had a cane and took a
coach in some instances, and appeared as
well as military officers of the first degree.
They used to walk about the streets with
a five-pound Bank of England note spread
out under their hat-bands; they would
smoke none but long churchwarden pipes,
and objected to the intrusion of any other
craftsman into the particular rooms of the
public-houses which they frequented.”
This abnormal prosperity, however, preceded
their downfall. Two events were
preparing it,—the invention of the power
loom and the application of steam power
to all the processes of manufacture.</p>

<p>Before considering the condition of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
laboring population after the establishment
of factories for weaving as well as for spinning,
we should glance backward into the
previous history of the laboring poor.
During the prevalence of the feudal system
the population of England was purely agricultural.
The chief landed proprietors
possessed a certain number of slaves who were
employed generally in domestic service, but
who also manufactured the wearing apparel
and household furniture. “Priests are set
apart for prayer,” says an ancient chronicle,
“but it is fit that noble chevaliers
should enjoy all ease, and taste all pleasures,
while the laborer toils, in order that
they may be nourished in abundance—they,
and their horse, and their dogs.”
This class of laborers, however, was never
very large.</p>

<p>The great body of the peasantry was
composed, first, of persons who rented
small farms, and who paid their rent either
in kind or in agricultural labor; and secondly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
of cottagers, each of whom had a
small parcel of land attached to his dwelling,
and the privilege of turning out a
cow, or pigs, or a few sheep into the woods,
commons and wastes of the manor. During
this whole period the entire population
derived its subsistence immediately
from the land. The mechanics of each
village, not having time to cultivate a
sufficient quantity of land to yield them a
sustenance, received a fixed annual allowance
of produce from each tenant. The
peasantry worked hard and fared scantily
enough, but still there was never an absolute
want of food; the whole body was
poor, but it contained no paupers.</p>

<p>During the fourteenth century the demand
for wool not only to supply the
markets of the Netherlands, but also the
newly established manufacture of England,
rapidly increased and the owners of the
land found sheep-feeding more profitable
than husbandry; and the sudden extension<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
of manufacture in the fifteenth century
greatly increased the demand. This
circumstance led to an important change
in the distribution of the population and
the peasants previously employed in tillage
were turned adrift upon the world.
The allotments of arable land which had
formerly afforded them the means of subsistence
were converted into sheep walks
and this policy greatly accelerated a social
revolution which had already commenced.
It eventually led to a complete severance
between the English peasantry and the
English soil; and with the exception of
those employed in domestic manufacture,
the little farmers and cottiers of the country
were converted into day laborers depending
entirely upon wages for their subsistence.</p>

<p>Thus when we come to consider the pitiable
condition of the working classes, following
the establishment of the factory, we
must remember this underlying cause of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
the poverty and suffering, holding in mind
the fact that from the beginning the increase
of English poor rates kept pace visibly
with the progress of the enclosure of
the common land. Complaints against
vagrancy and idleness, and the difficulty of
providing for the poor increased proportionately
with the progress of the system of
consolidating farms, and abstracting from
the English cottager his crofts and rights
to the common lands. Upon the factory
has fallen the blame for social conditions
which had their source in causes long
antedating its establishment—but the
factory has sufficient misery for which to
answer.</p>

<p>Arkwright’s inventions, as we have seen,
took manufactures out of the cottages
and farm houses of England and assembled
them in factories. Thousands of hands
were suddenly required especially in Lancashire,
which until then was comparatively
thinly populated. A great migration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
of population from the rural districts
to the manufacturing towns was set in
motion, thousands of families leaving the
quiet life of the country for the intenser
life of the city, but still the new demand
for labor was unsatisfied. The custom
sprang up of procuring apprentices from
the parish workhouses of London, Birmingham,
and elsewhere; and many thousand
children between the ages of seven
and fourteen years were thus sent to swell
the numbers of the laboring population.
Beside the factories stood apprentice houses
in which the children were lodged and
fed; and it was also the custom for the
master manufacturer to furnish the apprentice
with clothes.</p>

<p>The work required of the children was
exacting. The pay of the overseers was
fixed in proportion to the work produced,
a circumstance which bore hard on the
apprentices. The greatest cruelties were
practiced to spur the children to excessive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
labor; they were flogged, fettered, and
in many cases they were starved and some
were driven to commit suicide. We have
it on the authority of Mr. John Fielding,
himself, a master manufacturer and member
of Parliament for Oldham, that the
happiest moments in the lives of many of
these children were those passed in the
workhouse.</p>

<p>The profits of manufacturing were enormous
and so was the greed of the newborn
manufacturing aristocracy. Night
work was begun, the day shift going to
sleep in the same beds that the night shift
had just quitted, so that it was a common
saying in Lancashire that the beds never got
cold. Although the master manufacturers
were unmoved by the dictates of humanity,
they were not proof against the malignant
fevers which broke out in the congested
districts and spread their ravages throughout
the manufacturing towns.</p>

<p>Public opinion was soon aroused which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
led to the institution in Manchester of a
board of health which in the year 1796
made an interesting report. It appeared
that the children and others working in the
cotton factories were peculiarly disposed to
the contagion of fever; and that large factories
were generally injurious to those
employed in them even when no particular
disease prevailed, not only on account of
the close confinement and the debilitating
effect of the hot and impure air, but on
account of the untimely labor of the night
and the protracted hours of the working
day.</p>

<p>These conditions with respect to the
children not only tended to diminish the
sum of life by destroying the health and
thus affecting the vital stamina of the rising
generation; but it also encouraged idleness
and profligacy in the parents, who, in many
instances, lived upon the labor of their
children. It further appeared that the children
employed in factories were debarred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
from all opportunities of education as well
as from moral and religious instruction. The
investigation produced this report and nothing
more—“when the dangers of infection
were removed the precautions of mercy
were forgotten.”</p>

<p>Later, in the Parliamentary debate of
1815, Mr. Horner, one of the early factory
reformers, graphically described the practices
of the apprentice system. He told
how, with a bankrupt’s effects, a gang of
workhouse children were put up for sale
and publicly advertised as a part of the property;
how a number of boys apprenticed
by a parish in London to one manufacturer,
had been transferred to another and
in the process were left in a starving condition;
how an agreement had been made
between a London parish and a Lancashire
manufacturer by which it was stipulated
that with every twenty sound children one
idiot should be taken.</p>

<p>Among the master manufacturers who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
had been incredulous concerning these conditions
until the alarm of contagion arose,
was the first Sir Robert Peel. He made a
personal investigation and saw the abominations
of the system; he declared his
convictions and introduced into Parliament
the first legislative measure for the protection
of children. This was in the year
1802, and after many reverses he ultimately
obtained the act known as the 42d Geo.
III, “for the preservation of the Health
and Morals of Apprentices and others, employed
in Cotton and other mills.”</p>

<p>This act is chiefly interesting because it
established the principle of factory legislation,
a principle which later in the century
was greatly to promote the welfare of the
masses. His first bill, however, referred only
to apprentices and after its enactment children
instead of being imported from the
workhouses as formerly were nevertheless
hired from their parents. Their services
were dignified by the name of free labor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
but because they were not accorded the
protection given to apprentices their condition
was little better than that of actual
slavery.</p>

<p>The next step in the progress of factory
legislation was to extend the protection
to young persons engaged in manual
employment whether apprentices or not.
Time does not permit us to follow the
interesting history of factory legislation,
under the devoted leadership of Mr. Horner,
Sir John Hobhouse (afterwards Lord
Broughton), Mr. Saddler, and Lord Astley
(afterwards the Earl of Shaftesbury). But
the evidences of the social condition of the
toilers brought out by the Parliamentary
debates of 1816, 1818, 1819, and 1832,
are all of the same nature and reveal a
state of human misery without a parallel in
history.</p>

<p>We turn now from child labor to the
sanitary conditions of the manufacturing
towns. The report printed by Doctor Kay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
in 1832, is an astounding document; it
shows that out of six hundred and eighty-seven
streets inspected, more than one half
contained heaps of refuse or stagnant pools;
and of nearly seven thousand houses inspected,
more than one third were out of repair,
damp, or ill-ventilated, and an equally
large proportion lacked all sanitary conveniences,
even of the most primitive kind.</p>

<p>The population lived on the simplest
diet. Breakfast consisted of tea or coffee
with a little bread, while sometimes the
men had oatmeal porridge; dinner consisted
generally of boiled potatoes heaped
into one large dish over which melted lard
was poured and sometimes a few pieces of
fried fat bacon were added. Those who obtained
higher wages or families whose aggregate
income was large added a greater
portion of animal food to this meal at least
three times a week, but the quantity of
meat consumed by the laboring population
was not large.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>The typical family sat around the table,
plunging their spoons into the common
dish and with animal eagerness satisfied the
cravings of their appetite. The evening
meal consisted of tea, often mingled with
spirits and accompanied by a little bread.
The population thus scantily nourished was
crowded in one dense mass in cottages,
separated by narrow, unpaved streets, in an
atmosphere loaded with smoke. Engaged
in an employment which unremittingly
exhausted their physical energies, these
men and women lacked every moral and
intellectual stimulus; living in squalid
wretchedness and on meagre food it was
small wonder that their superfluous gains
were spent in debauchery. With domestic
economy neglected, domestic comfort unknown,
home had no other relation to the
factory operative than that of a shelter. At
this period the number of operatives above
the age of forty was incredibly small.</p>

<p>In a pamphlet printed during a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
turnout in 1831, we find certain very interesting
statistics concerning 1665 persons
whose ages ranged between fifteen and
sixty. Of these 1584 were under forty-five
years of age, only fifty-one between forty-five
and fifty were counted as fit for work,
while only three had lived to be sixty years
old. Such figures make it evident that
large numbers of workers, prematurely unfitted
for labor, came to live upon the toil
of their own children. Nor was this all,
for “puny and sickly parents gave birth
to puny and sickly children, and thus the
mischief continued its progress, one generation
transmitting its accumulated evils to
the next.”</p>

CHARTISM</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Such was the condition of the manufacturing
population of England in the
early days of the factory system. It is evident
that these conditions must inevitably
give rise to a deep social discontent which
sooner or later must become articulate, and
we find from the very beginning of the
factory system the records of innumerable
riots.</p>

<p>The history of these disturbances begins
with the opposition to the introduction
of new machinery. Rebellious craftsmen
bound themselves by fearful oaths into
secret organizations, the members of which
were known as Luddites, from the name of
their legendary leader—Ben Ludd. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
name was the password to their secret meetings,
at which plans were made for the
destruction of property, plans afterwards
carried out with open violence. Then followed
innumerable riots arising from that
growing social discontent which led in the
beginning to factory legislation, and later
to Parliamentary reform. It must not be
thought that only the factory folk were
discontented. The unrest was general
throughout the lower classes; it was felt,
moreover, in the ranks of the rapidly growing
middle class, and the justice of the
demand for better conditions was admitted
now and then by individuals in the governing
class—men of the broader vision. I
have in my possession an interesting pamphlet
containing the proceedings in the trial
of indictment against Thomas Walker, a
merchant of Manchester, and others, for a
conspiracy to overthrow the constitution
and government and to assist the French,
the King’s enemies, should they invade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
the Kingdom. The case was tried at the Assizes
at Lancaster, in 1794, and the account
throws light upon the true state of
the public mind in Manchester at that
time.</p>

<p>Thomas Walker, so it appeared to his
accusers, was a pernicious, seditious, and ill-disposed
person, greatly disaffected to the
King, and who did in the hearing of divers
liege subjects utter the words: “What are
kings! Damn the King!” Moreover, Mr.
Thomas Walker was a member of the
Manchester Reformation Society, a body
composed chiefly of working people. They
met at a public house—the Old Boar’s
Head, where the works of Tom Paine were
read aloud over innumerable pots of ale;
and a correspondence was carried on with
the Society of the Friends of the People
in London and with other more questionable
organizations. The publican, warned
by the magistrates that he must no longer
give entertainment to this society, turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
the reformers into the streets, whereupon
they sought shelter in the warehouse of Mr.
Walker. Here it was alleged they were
trained in the use of firearms; and here one
night they were attacked by members of
the Church and King Club, and a riot ensued.
The Reformation Society, however,
maintained that the sole object of their
meetings was to obtain, by constitutional
means, an adequate representation of the
people in Parliament.</p>

<p>Discontent continues rife in Manchester,
increasing with each year, and at last we
come to an event which typifies to all time
this upward struggle of toiling humanity—the
massacre on St. Peter’s Field which
occurred on the 16th of August, 1819.
Throughout the whole preceding summer,
on account of the distressed condition of
trade, discontent had been rife in the manufacturing
towns; agitation was at white
heat; and the voice of the demagogue was
heard with that of the conscientious reformer.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
It was proposed to hold at Manchester
on the 9th of August an immense meeting to
consider the election by the unrepresented
inhabitants of Manchester of a Parliamentary
delegate; but the purpose of this meeting
was declared illegal and it was prohibited
by the authorities. Then another
meeting was advertised to take place on
the 16th of August, the stated object being
to consider the most legal and effectual
means of obtaining Parliamentary reform.
It was said that this meeting was attended
by over one hundred thousand persons.</p>

<p>Several of the divisions that composed
the assembly came upon the field in regular
military formations, accompanied by
bands of music and preceded by banners
bearing such mottoes as “Equal Representation
or Death.” Many of the marchers
were armed with bludgeons. Most of the
columns, however, marched in silence; and
except for the loud shouts of defiance on
the appearance of the yeomen cavalry, sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
to disperse the meeting, there was no disturbance
on the part of the populace.</p>

<p>The assembly was in charge of Henry
Hunt, the famous radical, who, mounting
the platform which had been erected upon
a cart had just commenced his opening
speech when the civil authorities attempted
to arrest him. This the mob resisted,
whereupon the yeoman cavalry shouting,
“Have down with their banners!” charged
upon the field, put the crowds to flight, and
in the disorder which followed, a number
were killed and many were wounded.</p>

<p>Says Carlyle: “Who shall compute the
waste and loss, the obstruction of every sort,
that was produced in the Manchester region
by Peterloo alone. Some thirteen unarmed
men and women cut down—the number
of the slain and maimed is very countable;
but the treasury of rage, burning hidden
or visible in all hearts ever since, is of unknown
extent. ‘How ye came among us, in
your cruel armed blindness, ye unspeakable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
County Yeomanry, sabres flourishing, hoofs
prancing, and slashed us down at your brute
pleasure; deaf, blind to all our claims, and
woes and wrongs; of quick sight and sense
to your own claims only. There lie poor
sallow, workworn weavers, and complain
no more now; women themselves are
slashed and sabred, howling terror fills the
air; and ye ride prosperous, very victorious,—ye
unspeakable: Give us sabres too
and then come on a little!’”</p>

<p>The treasury of rage burning hidden
became visible to all. Chartism—the demand
of the people for equal political
rights—sprang into being; the outward
and visible sign of inward suppressed discontent
filled the manufacturing towns
with unrestrained murmurings, and government
felt the castle of privilege trembling
at its foundation. Some days later Sidmouth,
writing from Whitehall, congratulated
the yeomanry in the name of the
Prince Regent for their effective services in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
preserving public tranquillity. Public tranquillity
indeed! The cries of those stricken
weavers shall yet shake the empire of
Britain.</p>

<p>Peterloo was typical of the discontent
which had spread throughout the laboring
population of England. Parliament
was assembled in special session to consider
the state of the country and to enact measures
for the suppression of disorder. Lord
Grenfell in a brilliant speech discussed sedition,
declaring that the whole nation
was inundated with inflammatory publications
intended to stimulate the multitude
to acts of savage violence against all who
were eminent for birth or rank, for talent
or virtue. Mr. Canning placed the blame
entirely upon discontented radicals, underrating
the wide-spread demand for parliamentary
reform, and advocated the acts
which were passed prohibiting meetings
like the one held in Manchester, and in
other ways restricting the liberties of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
masses in discussing social conditions. All
of these acts tended to increase the discontent
and hasten forward that reform
which alone could save England from
revolution.</p>

<p>All famous Englishmen, however, did
not view Peterloo with the eyes of Lord
Grenfell or Mr. Canning. Writing to
Thomas Love Peacock, Shelley said:
“Many thanks for your attention in sending
the papers which contained the terrible
and important news of Manchester.
These are, as it were, the distant thunders
of the terrible storm which is approaching.
The tyrants here, as in the French Revolution,
have first shed blood. May their
execrable lessons not be learnt with equal
docility.” Inspired by the Manchester
massacre, Shelley wrote “The Masque of
Anarchy,” the spirit of which is summed
up in these stanzas:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Men of England, heirs of Glory,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Ye are many—they are few.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And in the same year he wrote:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Men of England, wherefore plough</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>
<p>Fortunately the appeal to arms was unnecessary.
The working classes of England
were destined to exemplify Shelley’s lesson,—but
by peaceful means,—were destined
to teach the world the great truth that the
many, if accordant and resolute, can always
control the few. And this peaceful conquest
is recorded in the history of Chartism.</p>

<p>I have known many labor agitators living
in the City of the Dinner Pail, and
almost without exception these men were
the sons of English Chartists. From them
I had learned to honor the early British
labor agitator, and to give to the name of
pothouse politician something more than a
contemptuous meaning. At the Old Boar’s
Head, in Manchester, and at many another
less famous public house in the manufacturing
cities, groups of workingmen gathered,
evening after evening to discuss their
wrongs; and over many a pot of ale, and
through many a cloud of tobacco smoke,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
there emerged at last certain definite demands
for reform.</p>

<p>Workingmen and radicals joined hands;
liberal leaders combined with working-class
leaders, and presently there was issued the
famous Charter with its six points,—manhood
suffrage, annual parliaments, the ballot,
abolition of property qualifications, payment
of members, and equality of electoral
districts. A very sober programme this, but
popular leaders like Fergus O’Connor and
Ernest Jones with incendiary oratory gave
it a revolutionary aspect.</p>

<p>So the discontent grew year by year, and
year by year it gathered force. Events in
France and elsewhere on the continent
excited the imagination of the governing
classes, and every meeting place of workingmen
appeared to be bristling with firearms,
but still the movement grew, and at
last the workingmen were ready with their
petition to Parliament. When, on the morning
of the 10th of April, 1848, bands of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
Chartists began to gather on Kennington
Common, carrying red banners and tricolors,
all London was astir with excitement.
Government had taken precaution for its
defense; the guns of the Tower were manned
and loaded; the employees of the post-office
were supplied with two thousand rifles; the
bank was surrounded with artillery; and behind
sand-bags piled upon its roof stood a
regiment of infantry. The bridges and approaches
to Westminster were defended by
an army of ten thousand horse, foot, and
artillery, while the six thousand police of
London lined the streets, supported by an
army of special constables. And in command
of this elaborate defense of the city
against four thousand unarmed workingmen
assembled on Kennington Common
to bear a petition to Parliament, was none
other than the Iron Duke himself—Wellington.
Surely the voice of the pothouse
politicians had been heard throughout England;
it had penetrated the halls of government—what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
need had the reformers for
powder and shot? And must we not believe
that when five years later the great
reform was enacted, credit for that event
was in some measure due to the resolute
and accordant factory folk? Yes, the wheels
and spindles of which Arkwright dreamed
brought something more than material
wealth to England; his vision made the nation
rich and powerful and his vision likewise
gave to the masses equal political
rights.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VII">VII<br>
THE FACTORY AND SOCIAL<br>
PROGRESS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">We have now traced the history of the
factory, from its beginning with
the inventions of Arkwright down to its
permanent establishment in the first half
of the last century, and we have noted its
influence upon the social life of England.
We have seen how, as early as the fifteenth
century, the introduction of manufactures
assisted in breaking down the feudal system,
and how, by making possible the accumulation
of wealth by men of humble
birth, it contributed to the rise of the
middle class. We have further seen that at
the close of the eighteenth century the introduction
of machinery intensified these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
tendencies and exerted a powerful influence
on the development of our modern
democracy.</p>

<p>We have, however, confined our attention
to a single industry as it developed in
a particular nation,—we have taken the
cotton factory as typical of all factories
and its growth in England as typical of
its growth throughout the Western world.
But the factory has developed differently
in each industry and its social influence
has never been quite alike in any two nations.
When, for instance, Samuel Slater
introduced cotton manufacturing into
America, he set up in Rhode Island an
exact counterpart of the English factory.
When, later, other factories were built in
New England there took place the same
transition of a vast laboring population
from the rural districts to the manufacturing
towns;—but this population was very
unlike the manufacturing population of
England. The American factories were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
operated by the sons and daughters of
Yankee farmers, reared in the atmosphere
of democracy and springing from a race
unaffected by the traditions of feudalism;
for them political equality had been already
won, yet even in America the factory became
an instrument for social progress. In
the rapidly growing manufacturing towns
these country folk found a new life of opportunity
for social advancement; they did
not remain operatives long, but advanced
to higher callings; and to take the places
which they left, thousands of workers came
from Lancashire here to enjoy that civic
freedom for which their brothers in the
Old World were still contending. To-day
in our Southern States we see a similar process
at work,—another race of men advancing
in the social scale by means of the
factory; from the mountains of the Carolinas
thousands of young men and women,
reared in a civilization almost unbelievably
primitive, are flocking to the manufacturing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
towns, there to enjoy the advantages
of modern life. But however varied
have been the phases of the development
of the factory in different parts of the world
there has always been this common phenomenon—the
concentration of the laboring
population in manufacturing cities and
the development of social discontent leading
to social progress.</p>

<p>The nineteenth century was the age of
Power Discovered; mechanical inventions,
the concentration of industry, the extension
of the factory system, new means of
transportation destroyed the last vestige of
the feudal world and left the democratic
ideal triumphant but unfulfilled: a new
century dawns,—the age of Power Humanized.
The industrial world in which
we live, with all its peculiar characteristics,
has been built upon the ruins of the feudal
order, and in due time will give place to
a newer and better civilization. Radicals
of to-day see visions of to-morrow; reformers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
fired by the visions seek to make
them real; while conservatives, clinging
to the traditions of a dead past, strive to
stay the inevitable progress of mankind.
Truth never changes, but the knowledge
of truth grows deeper with each age; no
political institution, no social institution
is sacred unless it is founded upon some
eternal truth, and all human institutions
must change with the increasing knowledge
of mankind. Everywhere in the
Western world the condition of the laboring
population is vastly better to-day than
when, a century and a half ago, the factory
was established; vastly better than when,
sixty years ago, the governments of Europe
trembled before a working-class revolt,—when
British Chartism triumphed in reform;
when Karl Marx, exiled from Prussia,
called upon the workingmen of the
world to unite; when Mazzini, another
exile in London, preached to the toilers of
Italy the gospel of God and humanity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
of progress through education. But the
evolution is incomplete, and the discontent
of the laboring population still remains
a vital force in the upward progress of
mankind.</p>

<p>To-day we in America are confronted
by the amazing spread of Socialism; Socialism
which the radicals preach, the reformers
seek to establish, and the conservatives
fear. We cannot evade its issues,
for Socialism is something more than a
political creed,—it is the modern expression
of that same spirit of human progress
which destroyed slavery in the ancient
world, serfdom in the middle ages and,
creating modern democracy, cannot rest
until it has guaranteed to all men not only
equal political rights but equal social rights.
Two men, smoke-room companions of
mine during a Pacific voyage, stand for
the contending ideals of the feudal and the
modern world. One was a noble earl, the
other a British tea merchant; both were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
men of wealth,—the one of large but unproductive
estates, the other of a great
business giving employment to thousands
of men. Of the two, the tea merchant,
though lacking in fine manners, was the
more important person; yet he would not
have exchanged those hours of familiar
gossip with the noble earl for more chests
of tea than would fill the hold of the ship.
And there was a reason for this feeling,
because the Groom of the Bedchamber
stood for that aristocracy of culture and
good manners which has an important
value in any society. Under the militant
structure of society this value belonged to
the few; in our present democracy it has
become increasingly the privilege of the
many. Public education, public libraries,
public art galleries, the perfected art of
printing have opened the highest culture
to children of the humblest birth. May we
not, then, look forward to the time when
“the best that has anywhere been in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
world shall be the lot of every man born
into it”—that is to say, the lot of every
man who desires the best?</p>

<p>Every thinking man must admit that
there is something wrong in our present
industrial régime. The progress of avowed
Socialism and the more rapid progress of
particular socialistic ideas indicate quite
clearly that we Americans are alive to the
unequal social conditions which now exist
and are anxious to find a remedy. But
whatever may be the utopian dreams of
the reformers, all immediate progress must
be made in the industrial world as we find
it to-day; the industrial state of the Socialist
is too remote in time,—our task
is with social conditions as they now exist.
The splendid machinery of production
created during the last century must not
be destroyed, but utilized for the benefit
of mankind. The question which we have
now to ask ourselves is this: What is
the ultimate purpose for which the business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
of the world is conducted, what the
real purpose of all this planting and reaping,
this mining and manufacturing, this
exchanging of commodities? Is it not,
primarily, to furnish each human creature
with food, shelter, and clothing,—the
means of supporting life? Men require
something more than the mere means of
subsistence; but before the individual
can cultivate his mind and soul his body
must be made comfortable, and this, after
all, is the whole end of our complex commercial
régime. The test of right and
wrong conduct in business refers to this
fundamental purpose,—that conduct only
is praiseworthy which advances the time
when every man capable of industry shall
be rewarded for his labor, not only with
a loaf of bread, but with hours of fruitful
leisure.</p>

<p>Captains of Industry! that was a noble
title Carlyle gave to the prosaic business
man, when gazing beyond the squalid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
turmoil of his day with its dominant
industrialism, triumphant mercantilism,
doctrines of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez-faire</i>, overproduction,
surplus population, he with clear vision
foresaw the future freedom of the masses
won through their own strength and the
ability of their leaders. Until Richard
Arkwright was born, the leaders of men in
their progress towards human freedom had
been soldiers; henceforward they were to
be men of affairs. Great soldiers won their
victory by the loyalty they inspired in
their followers; no adventurer seeking
personal glory ever won a lasting victory,
but only those heroes, forgetful of themselves
who consecrated their service to the
cause of freedom. In such wise must
Captains of Industry win their victories;
the adventurer can but for a time prevail;
fame is secure only to those leaders who
see in wealth accumulated a treasure held
in trust from which they are to feed and
clothe the armies that they lead to peaceful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
conquests. Social reformers of sentimental
temper have deemed the comparison
between the modern employer of labor
and the feudal lord as ill-chosen, but
history seems to justify it. Yet we have,
indeed, gone far since the Middle Ages.
When the feudal lord demanded loyalty
from his retainers the demand was alone
sufficient, but the Captain of Industry, in
order to obtain the loyalty of the toilers,
must not only demand but deserve it; he
too must be loyal to the great cause he
serves—the eternal cause of human freedom.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
